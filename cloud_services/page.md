This is not a tutorial on the individual services, they are discussed a bit more in depth here, but they have thriving communities that I would suggest reading instead.
In the aim of making our computer interactions available on any device, distributing them to the cloud is a key element, the main focus is to provide Nextcloud with file management, calendars, document collaboration. For developers the code-server gives us a cloud IDE (Visual Studio Code), setting up our shell and extensions to match our needs, now available on any device. We also discuss some tools for creative content developers who cannot find suitable tools for mobile devices, usually this is professional animation or video editing work and more in this blog post, even a comparison between LAN and cloud remote gaming. 

Remeber to see the `README.md` for how to fill in the `.env` file!
